Windows drivers for EC168

This is e3C EC168 DVB-T Device TV-tuner class of drivers for variety of EC168 based devices, usually from eBay. This driver works with Windows (tested with Windows 10 x64) and will enable TV tuner functionality.

I personally used VLC player for testing out TV strem signal and quality, and still am looking for good free TV Tuner software. Other suggestion would be Windows Media Center, but that was deprecated and removed from Windows 10. However, there's method to get it back which I will skip explaining here, but Google is your friend :)
